intro_text = r"""
In this assignment we will combine theory from assignments a wide array of course topics to implement a computationally efficient multi-stage decimator on our STM32 Nucleo board. The system will allow us to perform ***oversampling***, which is a technique to safeguard against aliasing as well as in certain cases to increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a sampled signal by sampling a input signal at a much higher rate than that determined by the sampling theorem.

The purpose of the assignment is to provide a relevant example for use of sample rate conversion. In addition, the assignment will walk you through the process of developing a DSP system using Python before impementing it on an STM32 to run in real-time. The experience gained from working on the assignment will therefore be highly relevant for part 3 of the portfolio project.
